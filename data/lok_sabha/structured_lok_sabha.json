It can, however, recommend amendments in a Money Bill.  It is open to the Lok Sabha to accept or reject any or all of the recommendations of  the Rajya Sabha with regard to a Money Bill.  If the Lok Sabha accepts any of the recommendations of the  Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses with amendments recommended by the Rajya Sabha and accepted by the Lok Sabha and if the Lok Sabha does not accept any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the form in which it was passed by the  Lok Sabha without any of the amendments recommended by the  Rajya Sabha.  If a Money Bill  passed by  the Lok Sabha and transmitted to the Rajya Sabha  is not returned to the Lok Sabha within the period of fourteen days, it is deemed to have been passed by both Houses at the expiration of the said period in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha. \u00c2\u00b7         Budget Session                              -  February - May \u00c2\u00b7         Autumn or Monsoon Session           -  July - August \u00c2\u00b7         Winter Session                               -  November - December \"Prorogation\" means the termination of a Session of the House by an order made by the  President under article 85(2)(a) of the Constitution.  The Prorogation of the House may take place any time, even while the House is sitting.  However, usually, prorogation follows the adjournment of the sitting of the House sine die. \"Dissolution\" of the House means the end of the life of the Lok Sabha either by an order made by the  President under article 85 (2) (b) of the Constitution or on the expiration of the period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. Dissolution puts an end to the representative character of the individuals who at the time compose the Lok Sabha. On adjournment of the Lok Sabha or its adjournment sine die, the pending business does not lapse.  Bills pending before either House or Select/Joint Committee, Motions, Resolutions, and amendments which have already been moved and pending in the House, and business pending before a Parliamentary Committee do not lapse on prorogation whereas all business pending before the House or any of its Committee lapse on dissolution.  Prorogation terminates a Session and does not constitute an interruption in the continuity of life of the Lok Sabha which is brought to an end only by dissolution. (i)        Voice Vote:  It is a simple method for deciding a question put by the Chair on a motion made by  a Member.  Under this method, the question before the House is determined by the `Ayes' or the `Noes', as the case may be. (ii)         Division:  There are three methods of holding a Division, i.e.  (a) by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment; (b) by distributing `Ayes' and `Noes' slips in the House; and (c) by Members going into the Lobbies.  However, the method of recording of votes in the Lobbies has become obsolete ever since the installation of the Automatic Vote Recording Machine. (iii)        Secret Ballot:  During an 'open' voting period, the individual results are shown by the three Colours: Green for \u2018Ayes\u2019, Red for \u2018Noes\u2019 and Yellow for \u2018Abstain\u2019 on the Individual Result Display Panel. Secret  voting, if any, is held on similar lines except that the Light Emitting Diode (LED) on the Individual Result Display Panel flashes only white light to show that the vote has been recorded. (iv)         Recording of votes by distribution of slips:  The method of recording of votes by Members on `Ayes' and `Noes' slips is generally resorted to in the eventuality of (i) sudden failure of the working of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment; and (ii) at the commencement of the new Lok Sabha, before the seats/division numbers have been allotted to Members. (v)           Physical count of Members in their places instead of a formal division:  If in the opinion of the Chair, a Division is unnecessarily claimed, he/she may ask the Members who are for `Ayes' and those for `Noes', respectively, to rise in their places and on a count being taken, he/she may declare the determination of the House.  In such a case, the particulars of voting of the Members are not recorded. (vi)         Casting Vote:  If in a Division the number of `Ayes' and `Noes' is equal, the question is decided by the casting vote of the Chair.  Under the Constitution, the Speaker or the person acting as such cannot vote in a Division; he/she has only a casting vote which he/she must exercise in the case of equality of votes. Question 42: What is Question Hour? Starred: A Member who desires an oral answer to his question is required to distinguish it by an asterix. Maximum 20 Questions are included in the list of Starred Questions for a particular day. This is printed on green paper. Minimum of 15 clear days notice is required for tabling Starred Questions. The Questions not orally answered in the Starred list of questions are treated as Unstarred Questions and their replies are laid on the Table of the House. Unstarred: These do not carry the asterix mark and are meant for obtaining written reply. Not more than 230 Questions can be placed on the Unstarred list for a particular sitting. This list is printed on white paper. Minimum 15 clear days notice is required for tabling Unstarred Questions. Written answers given by the Ministers are deemed to have been laid on the Table of the House at the end of Question Hour. Short Notice Question: Question can also be asked on a matter of urgent public importance at a notice of less than ten clear days. The list of admitted SNQ is printed on a pink paper. The procedure of SNQ is regulated by Rule 54 and the basic test for its admissibility is the urgency of matter. SNQ is asked and answered soon after the Question Hour. Question to Private Members: A Question may also be addressed to a Private Member under Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, which provides that the subject matter of the question should be related to some Bill, Resolution or other matter connected with the Business of the House for which that Member is responsible. For instance, the Questions which relates to matters under the purview of Parliamentary Committees can be addressed to respective Chairperson. Similarly, Members piloting Private Members Bills and Resolutions can be addressed questions, which are within cognizance of them under this provision. The procedure in regard to such questions is the same as that followed in the case of questions addressed to a Minister with such variations as the Speaker may consider necessary. "

Thereafter, the Bill is taken up for clause-by-clause consideration as introduced or as reported by the Select/Joint Committee. The third stage is confined to the discussion on the motion that the Bill be passed and the Bill is passed/rejected either by voting or voice vote (or returned to the Lok Sabha by the Rajya Sabha in the case of a Money Bill). In yet another significant development implemented from 2017 was the presentation of an integrated Budget, that is, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget, thereby discontinuing a 92-year old practice of presentation of two separate budgets "

    "PROCEDURAL DEVICES FOR RAISING MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST": {
        "59": {
            "question": " What is a Calling Attention ?",
            "answer": "Under this procedural device, a Member may, with the prior permission of the Speaker, call the attention of a Minister to any matter of urgent public importance and the Minister may make a brief statement thereon. There shall be no debate on such a statement at the time it is made.  After the statement, brief clarifications can be sought from the Minister by the Member who has initiated the Calling Attention and other Members whose names appear in the List of Business are called by the Speaker.   Only those matters which are primarily the concern of the Union Government can be raised through a Calling Attention notice.  The Calling Attention procedure is an Indian innovation which combines asking a question with supplementaries and making brief comments; the Government also gets adequate opportunity to state its case.  The Calling Attention matter is not subject to the vote of the House."

            "question": " What is a Motion?",
            "answer": "The term `motion' in parliamentary parlance means any formal proposal  made  to the House by a Member for the purpose of  eliciting a decision of the House.  It is phrased in such a way that, if adopted, it will purport to express the judgement or will of the House.  Any matter of importance can be the subject matter of a motion.  The mover of a motion frames it in a form in which he/she wishes it ultimately to be passed by the House and on which a vote of the House can conveniently be taken."

        "62": {
            "question": " What is an Adjournment Motion?",
            "answer": "Adjournment Motion is the procedure for adjournment of the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, which can be moved with the consent of the Speaker.  The Adjournment Motion, if admitted, leads to setting aside of the normal business of the House for discussing the matter mentioned in the motion.  To be in order, an adjournment motion must raise a matter of sufficient public importance to warrant interruption of normal business of the House and the question of public importance is decided on merit in each individual case.  The purpose of an Adjournment Motion is to take the Government to task for a recent act of omission or commission having serious consequences.  Its adoption is regarded as a sort of censure of the Government."

        "63": {
            "question": " What is a Motion of No-confidence?",
            "answer": "The Government must always enjoy majority support in the popular House to remain in power.  If need be, it has to demonstrate its strength on the floor of the House by moving a Motion of Confidence and winning the confidence of the House.  In view of the express Constitutional provision regarding collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha, a motion expressing want of confidence in an individual Minister is out of order; under the Rules, only a motion expressing want of confidence in the Council of Ministers as a body is admissible.  Rule 198 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha lays down the procedure for moving a Motion of No-Confidence in the Council of Ministers.  The usual format of such a motion is that \"this House expresses its want of confidence in the Council of Ministers\". A Motion of No-confidence need not set out any grounds on which it is based.  Even when grounds are mentioned in the notice and read out in the House, they do not form part of the No-confidence Motion."

            "question": " What is meant by a Discussion under Rule 193?",
            "answer": "Discussion under Rule 193 does not involve a formal motion before the House.  Hence no voting can take place after discussion on matters under this rule.  The Member who gives notice may make a short statement and such of the Members as have previously intimated to the Speaker, may be permitted to take part in the discussion.  The Member who raises the discussion has no right of reply.  At the end of the discussion, the Minister concerned gives a brief reply."

Under this Rule, Members can raise discussion for short durations without a formal motion or vote thereon."

            "answer": "Matters, which are not points of order can be raised by way of Special Mentions under Rule 377.  This procedural device, framed in 1954, provides opportunity to the Members to raise matters of general public interest.  At present, the number of matters that can be raised by Members under rule 377 on a single day is 20."

As it starts around 12 noon, this period is euphemistically termed as `Zero Hour'.  For raising matters during the \u2018Zero Hour\u2019 in Lok Sabha, Members give notice between 8.30 a.m.  and  9.00 a.m. everyday to the Speaker stating clearly the subject which they consider to be important and wish to raise in the House.  It is, of course, for the Speaker to allow or not to allow for raising  such matters in the House.  The term `Zero Hour' is not formally recognised in our parliamentary procedure."

            "question": " How many matters are allowed to be raised under  \u2018Zero Hour\u2019 ?",
            "answer": "At present, twenty matters per day as per their priority in the ballot are allowed to be raised during \"Zero Hour\".  The order in which the matters will be raised is decided by the Speaker at his/her discretion.  In the first phase, 5 matters of urgent national and international importance, as decided by the Chair, are taken up after Question Hour and laying of papers, etc.  In the second phase, the remaining admitted matters of urgent public importance are taken up after 6.00 P.M. or at the end of the regular business of the House. However, since there is no provision in the rules regarding \u2018Zero Hour\u2019, hence there is no maximum limit on the number of matters that can be raised on any given day."

Any action on the part of a Member which mars the occasion   or creates disturbance is punishable by the House to which that    Member belongs. Discussion on matters referred to in the Address takes place on a Motion of Thanks moved by a Member and seconded by another Member.  The scope of discussion on the Address is very wide and the functioning of the entire administration is open for discussion; the limitations inter alia are that Members should not refer to matters which are not the direct responsibility of the Government of India, and the name of the President should not be brought in during the debate since the Government, and not the President, is responsible for the contents of the Address."

            "question": " Are Members of Parliament entitled to any pension?",
            "answer": "A substantive motion is a self-contained, independent proposal made in reference to a subject which the mover wishes to bring forward.  All Resolutions,  Motions for election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, and Motion of Thanks on the Address by the President, etc. are examples of substantive  motions. A substitute motion, as its name suggests, is moved in substitution of the original motion for taking into consideration  a policy or situation or statement or any other matter.   Amendments to substitute motions are not permissible. Subsidiary motions depend upon or relate to other motions or follow up on some proceedings in the House.  By itself, a subsidiary motion has no meaning and is not capable of stating the decision of the House without reference to the original motion or the proceedings of the House. Admitted notices of such motions may be placed before the Business Advisory Committee for selecting the motions for discussion in the House according to the urgency and importance of the subject-matter thereof, and allotting time for the same. Resolutions which are expression of opinion by the House: Since the purpose of such a Resolution is merely to obtain an expression of opinion of the House, the Government is not bound to give effect to the opinions expressed in these Resolutions. Resolutions which have statutory effect: The notice of a Statutory Resolution is given in pursuance of a provision in the Constitution or an Act of Parliament.  Such a Resolution, if adopted, is binding on the Government and has the force of law. Resolutions which the House passes in the matter of control over its own proceedings:  It has the force of law and its validity cannot be challenged in any court of law.  The House, by such a Resolution, evolves, sometimes, its own procedure to meet a situation not specifically provided for in the Rules. A Point of Order may be raised only in relation to the business before the House at the moment, provided that the Speaker may permit a Member to raise a Point of Order during the interval between the termination of one item of business and the commencement of another if it relates to maintenance of order in, or arrangement of business before, the House.  A Member may formulate a Point of Order and the Speaker shall decide whether the point raised is a Point of Order and if so give the decision thereon, which is final.  PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES/IMMUNITIES, SALARIES AND EMOLUMENTS Contempt of the House may be defined generally as any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officers of such House in the discharge of his or her duty, or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results even though there is no precedent of the offence.  Whereas all breaches of privilege are contempts  of the House, a person may be guilty of a contempt of the House even though he does not violate any of the privilege of the House, e.g. when he disobeys an order to attend a Committee or publishes reflections on the character or conduct of a Member in his capacity as a Member."

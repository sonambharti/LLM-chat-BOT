?Answer: Under this procedural device, a Member may, with the prior permission of the Speaker, call the attention of a Minister to any matter of urgent public importance and the Minister may make a brief statement thereon.There shall be no debate on such a statement at the time it is made.After the statement, brief clarifications can be sought from the Minister by the Member who has initiated the Calling Attention and other Members whose names appear in the List of Business are called by the Speaker.Only those matters which are primarily the concern of the Union Government can be raised through a Calling Attention notice.The Calling Attention procedure is an Indian innovation which combines asking a question with supplementaries and making brief comments; the Government also gets adequate opportunity to state its case.The Calling Attention matter is not subject to the vote of the House.Question:  What is a Motion?Answer: The term `motion' in parliamentary parlance means any formal proposal  made  to the House by a Member for the purpose of  eliciting a decision of the House.It is phrased in such a way that, if adopted, it will purport to express the judgement or will of the House.Any matter of importance can be the subject matter of a motion.The mover of a motion frames it in a form in which he/she wishes it ultimately to be passed by the House and on which a vote of the House can conveniently be taken.Question:  What are the different types of Motions?Answer: Motions may be classified into three broad categories, namely, substantive motions, substitute motions and subsidiary motions.Question:  What is an Adjournment Motion?Answer: Adjournment Motion is the procedure for adjournment of the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, which can be moved with the consent of the Speaker.The Adjournment Motion, if admitted, leads to setting aside of the normal business of the House for discussing the matter mentioned in the motion.To be in order, an adjournment motion must raise a matter of sufficient public importance to warrant interruption of normal business of the House and the question of public importance is decided on merit in each individual case.The purpose of an Adjournment Motion is to take the Government to task for a recent act of omission or commission having serious consequences.Its adoption is regarded as a sort of censure of the Government.Question:  What is a Motion of No-confidence?Answer: The Government must always enjoy majority support in the popular House to remain in power.If need be, it has to demonstrate its strength on the floor of the House by moving a Motion of Confidence and winning the confidence of the House.In view of the express Constitutional provision regarding collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha, a motion expressing want of confidence in an individual Minister is out of order; under the Rules, only a motion expressing want of confidence in the Council of Ministers as a body is admissible.Rule 198 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha lays down the procedure for moving a Motion of No-Confidence in the Council of Ministers.The usual format of such a motion is that \"this House expresses its want of confidence in the Council of Ministers\".A Motion of No-confidence need not set out any grounds on which it is based.Even when grounds are mentioned in the notice and read out in the House, they do not form part of the No-confidence Motion.Question:  What is a No-Day-Yet-Named Motion?Answer: If the Speaker admits notice of a motion and no date is fixed for its discussion, it is called a \"No-Day-yet-Named Motion\" and a copy of the admitted motion is forwarded to the Minister concerned with the subject matter of the motion.Question:  What is meant by a Discussion under Rule 193?Answer: Discussion under Rule 193 does not involve a formal motion before the House.Hence no voting can take place after discussion on matters under this rule.The Member who gives notice may make a short statement and such of the Members as have previously intimated to the Speaker, may be permitted to take part in the discussion.The Member who raises the discussion has no right of reply.At the end of the discussion, the Minister concerned gives a brief reply.Question:  What is a Short Duration Discussion?Answer: In order to provide opportunities to Members to discuss matters of urgent public importance, a convention was established in March 1953 which was incorporated later into the Rules of Procedure and conduct of Business in Lok Sabha under Rule 193 as Short Duration Discussion.Under this Rule, Members can raise discussion for short durations without a formal motion or vote thereon.Question:  What is meant by matters under Rule 377?Answer: Matters, which are not points of order can be raised by way of Special Mentions under Rule 377.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"},

provides opportunity to the Members to raise matters of general public interest.At present, the number of matters that can be raised by Members under rule 377 on a single day is 20.Question:  What is \u2018Zero Hour\u2019 ?Answer: The time immediately following the Question Hour  and laying of papers and before any listed business is taken up in the House has come to be popularly known as the `Zero Hour'.As it starts around 12 noon, this period is euphemistically termed as `Zero Hour'.For raising matters during the \u2018Zero Hour\u2019 in Lok Sabha, Members give notice between 8.30 a.m.  and  9.00 a.m. everyday to the Speaker stating clearly the subject which they consider to be important and wish to raise in the House.It is, of course, for the Speaker to allow or not to allow for raising  such matters in the House.The term `Zero Hour' is not formally recognised in our parliamentary procedure.Question:  How many matters are allowed to be raised under  \u2018Zero Hour\u2019 ?Answer: At present, twenty matters per day as per their priority in the ballot are allowed to be raised during \"Zero Hour\".The order in which the matters will be raised is decided by the Speaker at his/her discretion.In the first phase, 5 matters of urgent national and international importance, as decided by the Chair, are taken up after Question Hour and laying of papers, etc.In the second phase, the remaining admitted matters of urgent public importance are taken up after 6.00 P.M. or at the end of the regular business of the House.However, since there is no provision in the rules regarding \u2018Zero Hour\u2019, hence there is no maximum limit on the number of matters that can be raised on any given day.Question:  What is a Resolution?Answer: A Resolution is a formal expression of the sense, will or action of the Legislative Body.Resolutions may be broadly divided into three categories:\nQuestion:  What is a Point of Order?Answer: A Point of Order relates to the

question which is within the cognizance of the Speaker.Question:  Does the Speaker have the power to adjourn the House or suspend the sitting?Answer: Under Rule 375, in the case of a grave disorder arising in the House, the Speaker may, if thinks it necessary to do so, adjourn the House or suspend any sitting for a time to be named by the Speaker.Question:  When does the President address the Parliament?Answer: The Constitution provides for an Address by the President to either House or  both  Houses   assembled together [Article 86(1)].The Constitution  also makes incumbent upon the President to address both Houses of Parliament assembled together at the commencement of the first Session after  each General Election to the Lok Sabha and at the commencement of the first Session each year and inform Parliament of the causes of its summons.[Article 87(1)].The matters referred to in the Address by the President to the Houses are discussed on a Motion of Thanks moved by a Member and seconded by another Member.Question:  Can Members raise questions on the Address by the President?Answer: No Member can raise questions on the Address by the President.Any action on the part of a Member which mars the occasion   or creates disturbance is punishable by the House to which that    Member belongs.Discussion on matters referred to in the Address takes place on a Motion of Thanks moved by a Member and seconded by another Member.The scope of discussion on the Address is very wide and the functioning of the entire administration is open for discussion; the limitations inter alia are that Members should not refer to matters which are not the direct responsibility of the Government of India, and the name of the President should not be brought in during the debate since the Government, and not the President, is responsible for the contents of the Address.Question:  What are parliamentary privileges?Answer: The term `parliamentary privilege' refers to certain rights and immunities enjoyed by each House of Parliament and Committees of each House collectively, and by Members  of each House individually,  without which they cannot discharge their functions efficiently and effectively.The object of parliamentary privileges is to safeguard the freedom, the authority and the dignity of Parliament.The powers, privileges and immunities of either House of Parliament and of its Committees and Members have mainly been laid down in article 105 of the Constitution.The House has the power to punish any person who commits a contempt of the House or a  breach of  any of its privileges.Question:  Are the parliamentary privileges codified in India?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

proposal made in reference to a subject which the mover wishes to bring forward.All Resolutions,  Motions for election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, and Motion of Thanks on the Address by the President, etc.are examples of substantive  motions.A substitute motion, as its name suggests, is moved in substitution of the original motion for taking into consideration  a policy or situation or statement or any other matter.Amendments to substitute motions are not permissible.Subsidiary motions depend upon or relate to other motions or follow up on some proceedings in the House.By itself, a subsidiary motion has no meaning and is not capable of stating the decision of the House without reference to the original motion or the proceedings of the House.Admitted notices of such motions may be placed before the Business Advisory Committee for selecting the motions for discussion in the House according to the urgency and importance of the subject-matter thereof, and allotting time for the

thereof, when in his/her opinion, it is an abuse of the right of questioning or is calculated to obstruct or prejudicially affect the procedure of the House or is in contravention of the Rules.The right to ask a question is governed by certain conditions like it should be pointed, specific and confined to one issue only.It should not contain arguments, inferences, ironical expressions, imputations, epithets or defamatory statements.Question:  What is an Half-an-Hour Discussion?Answer: Another instrument available to the Members of Lok Sabha for raising issue of public importance is the Half-an-Hour Discussion.Under this, a Member may raise discussion on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question, Starred, Unstarred or Short Notice Question and the answer to which needs further elucidation on a matter of fact.Question:  What is the procedure for Half-an-Hour Discussion?Answer: The procedure regarding Half-an-Hour Discussion is regulated by Rule 55 of the \u2018Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha\u2019 and Direction 19 of the \u2018Directions by the Speaker\u2019.Under this, a Member may give notice to

one notice of Half-an-Hour Discussion is put down for a sitting and no formal motion is moved in the House nor does voting take place.The Member who has given notice makes a short statement and the Members who have previously intimated the Speaker and have secured one of the four places in the ballot are permitted to put a question each for the purpose of further elucidating any matter of fact.Thereafter, the Minister concerned replies briefly.Question:  When a Half-an-Hour Discussion is taken up?Answer: A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha.The Rajya Sabha cannot make

within the period of fourteen days, it is deemed to have been passed by both Houses at the expiration of the said period in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha.\u00c2\u00b7         Budget

place any time, even while the House is sitting.However, usually, prorogation follows the adjournment of the sitting of the House sine die.\"Dissolution\" of the House means the end of the life of the Lok Sabha either by an order made by the  President under article 85 (2) (b) of the Constitution or on the expiration of the period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting.Dissolution puts an end to the representative character of the individuals who at the time compose the Lok Sabha.On adjournment of the Lok Sabha or its adjournment sine die, the pending business does not lapse.Bills pending before either House or Select/Joint Committee, Motions, Resolutions, and amendments which have already been moved and pending in the House, and business pending before a Parliamentary Committee do not lapse on prorogation whereas all business pending before the House or any of its Committee lapse on dissolution.Prorogation terminates a Session and does not constitute an interruption in the continuity of life of the Lok Sabha which is brought to an end only by dissolution.(i)        Voice Vote:  It is a simple method for deciding a question put by the Chair on a motion made by  a Member.Under this method, the question before the House is determined by the `Ayes' or the `Noes', as the case may be.(ii)         Division:  There are three methods of holding a Division, i.e.(a) by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment; (b) by distributing `Ayes' and `Noes' slips in the House; and (c) by Members going into the Lobbies.However, the method of recording of votes in the Lobbies has become obsolete ever since the installation of the Automatic Vote Recording Machine.(iii)        Secret Ballot:  During an 'open' voting period, the individual results are shown by the three Colours: Green for \u2018Ayes\u2019, Red for \u2018Noes\u2019 and Yellow for \u2018Abstain\u2019 on the Individual Result Display Panel.Secret  voting, if any, is held on similar lines except that the Light Emitting Diode (LED) on the Individual Result Display Panel flashes only white light to show that the vote has been recorded.(iv)         Recording of votes by distribution of slips:  The method of recording of votes by Members on `Ayes' and `Noes' slips is generally resorted to in the eventuality of (i) sudden failure of the working of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment; and (ii) at the commencement of the new Lok Sabha, before the seats/division numbers have been allotted to Members.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

Division is unnecessarily claimed, he/she may ask the Members who are for `Ayes' and those for `Noes', respectively, to rise in their places and on a count being taken, he/she may declare the determination of the House.In such a case, the particulars of voting of the Members are not recorded.(vi)         Casting Vote:  If in a Division the number of `Ayes' and `Noes' is equal, the question is decided by the casting vote of the Chair.Under the Constitution, the Speaker or the person acting as such cannot vote in a Division; he/she has only a casting vote which he/she must exercise in the case of equality of votes.Question 42: What is Question Hour?Starred: A Member who desires an oral answer to his question is required to distinguish it by an asterix.Maximum 20 Questions are included

Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, which provides that the subject matter of the question should be related to some Bill, Resolution or other matter connected with the Business of the House for which that Member is responsible.For instance, the Questions which relates to matters under the purview of Parliamentary Committees can be addressed to respective Chairperson.Similarly, Members piloting Private Members Bills and Resolutions can be addressed questions, which are within cognizance of them under this provision.The procedure in regard to such questions is the same as that followed in the case of questions addressed to a Minister with such variations as the Speaker may consider necessary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

Depending on their contents, Bills may further be classified broadly into (a)  Original Bills (Bills embodying new proposals, ideas or policies); (b) Amending Bills (Bills which seek to modify, amend or revise the existing Acts); (c) Consolidating Bills (Bills which seek to consolidate existing laws on a particular subject;  (d) Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bills (Bills to continue an expiring Act); (e) Repealing Bills (Bills seeking to repeal existing Acts); (f) Bills to replace Ordinances; (g) Constitution (Amendment) Bills; and (h) Money and Financial Bills.\nQuestion:  Who decides whether a Bill is an ordinary Bill or a Money Bill?\nAnswer: In case any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker, Lok Sabha, thereon, is final.  When a Bill is held to be a Money Bill, the Speaker endorses a certificate thereon duly signed by the Speaker to that effect that it is a Money Bill before the Bill is sent to the Rajya Sabha or presented to the President for assent.\nQuestion:  What is the difference between a Bill and an Act?\nAnswer: A Bill is a draft legislative proposal before the House.  It becomes an Act only when passed by both the Houses of Parliament and assented to by the President.\nQuestion:  What are the various steps involved in the passage of a Bill?\nAnswer: A Bill while being considered has to undergo three stages in each House of Parliament. The first stage consists of the introduction of the Bill which is done on a motion moved by either a Minister or a Member.\nQuestion:  What is Budget?\nAnswer: Budget is the `Annual Financial Statement'  or the Statement of the Estimated Receipts and Expenditure of the Government of India in respect of each financial year, presented to the Lok Sabha on such day as the President may direct.  A copy of the Budget is laid in the Rajya Sabha soon after its presentation in the Lok Sabha.  The preparation and presentation of the Budget for the approval of the Legislature is a constitutional obligation on the part of the Government, both at the Centre and in the States.\nQuestion:  When is the Budget Session of Parliament held?\nAnswer: The Budget Session of Parliament is normally held during February to May of the year.  During this period, the  Budget comes before the Parliament for its deliberation, voting and approval; the Departmentally related Standing Committees consider the Demands for Grants of Ministries/Departments and report on the same to the Houses of Parliament.\nQuestion:  Who presents the Budget in the House?\nAnswer: During the second stage, any of the following motions can be moved: that the Bill be taken into consideration; that it be referred to a Select Committee of the House; that it be referred to a Joint Committee of the two Houses; or that it be circulated for the purpose of eliciting opinion thereon. Thereafter, the Bill is taken up for clause-by-clause consideration as introduced or as reported by the Select/Joint Committee. The third stage is confined to the discussion on the motion that the Bill be passed and the Bill is passed/rejected either by voting or voice vote (or returned to the Lok Sabha by the Rajya Sabha in the case of a Money Bill). In yet another significant development implemented from 2017 was the presentation of an integrated Budget, that is, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget, thereby discontinuing a 92-year old practice of presentation of two separate budgets", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"bec840c8-7d57-4be6-9d24-cfeaea49966a": {"node_ids": ["5a8645c6-4cd8-4ccd-905a-287dc6879a50"], "metadata": {}}, "c1e9e3bf-c8bd-485e-9dca-cc1e1ac39a0f": {"node_ids": ["78eb3eec-12af-497a-8327-4e50eb51db98"], "metadata": {}}, "dba9bdfe-e447-4527-83eb-4c4a056f5e59": {"node_ids": ["651248b2-ce13-4df0-8b1e-b9d0355cfdf8"], "metadata": {}}, "9833a865-f423-4b3c-9374-3559679f9a07": {"node_ids": ["6666634d-e32d-4b3f-bfc3-0b8452427815"], "metadata": {}}, "1b21fdac-d1e9-45bc-a893-db94adbf631c": {"node_ids": ["d2e0aceb-c426-43e9-a161-7600a256ee0e", "b04acce2-af88-4462-80fa-2bbe769e35ce", "3d95aec5-f043-48f6-a6ee-8cf75ba3e1ff", "676ce69e-78d0-4054-976d-0d3340cc95b8"], "metadata": {}}, "5e4dcc0a-4622-422c-8536-92c3c4109488": {"node_ids": ["2d793a0a-64d6-41b6-a532-cbeb5af64b20"], "metadata": {}}, "afe7ed66-c1f5-4e0f-9727-ee33c8284c6b": {"node_ids": ["7dc02c95-f553-44c1-9d5f-964aece9642f", "29b59bdc-dde9-4e5a-8528-57013c36f2ec", "5cd68208-6363-4ce3-9980-71e58c4cdecc", "5a8cb63d-9285-4293-86eb-60913b3f6da1"], "metadata": {}}, "e31287d2-d35b-412d-a362-aef091c72b6a": {"node_ids": ["1b1af68e-d3d7-4289-b0a8-05a93a4a76bc"], "metadata": {}}, "b7a5d77b-db36-41aa-8631-76cab027663d": {"node_ids": ["5b1316b6-fd5b-4cd5-bb1c-3efab2041ef5"], "metadata": {}}, "f2370700-9b0b-42b8-80b4-65137b7f363a": {"node_ids": ["5a34b0d7-0cb9-4750-a5de-791860a98a96"], "metadata": {}}}}
